# 💻 90 Java Programming Problems – Logic Building Series

> 📅 Started on: July 1, 2025
> 🧠 Author: Celshiya C
> 🎓 Purpose: **To revise Java concepts learned during college (Semester 2) and build a strong foundation in problem-solving before diving into Data Structures & Algorithms.**

## 🚀 About This Repository

This repository is a step-by-step log of solving **90 core Java problems**, starting from simple input/output to moderately complex logic-building challenges. 
It’s meant to **revise Java syntax**, **sharpen programming logic**, and prepare for solving **DSA problems** more confidently.

After completing this 90-problem series, I’ll be moving into **full DSA preparation** — and that too will be documented here on GitHub.

## 🧩 Structure of Problems

🗂️ Problems are organized into packages based on their category and difficulty:

| Level | Category                   | Package                          |
|-------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 01    | Basics (I/O, Operators)    | `com.celshiya.level01_basics`    |
| 02    | Math & Number Logic        | `com.celshiya.level02_math`      |
| 03    | Number Properties          | `com.celshiya.level03_numberprops`|
| 04    | Pattern Printing           | `com.celshiya.level04_patterns`  |
| 05    | Arrays                     | `com.celshiya.level05_arrays`    |
| 06    | Strings                    | `com.celshiya.level06_strings`   |
| 07    | Functions & Recursion      | `com.celshiya.level07_functions` |
| 08    | Interview-style Logic      | `com.celshiya.level08_logic`     |
| 09    | Mini Projects              | `com.celshiya.level09_miniprojects`|

Each problem includes:
- ✅ Problem statement (in comments)
- 💻 Clean Java code (Eclipse IDE)
- 🧪 Test cases or example inputs/outputs

## 📘 Sample Problems

- Print Hello World
- Add Two Numbers
- Check Even or Odd
- Find Factorial
- Check Palindrome
- Armstrong Number
- Sum of Digits
- Reverse a Number
- Print Patterns (stars, numbers)
- Swap Two Numbers without Temp

...and many more building up to mini-project-level logic.

## 📌 Goal After This Repo

After completing these 90 Java problems, I’ll start full-fledged **DSA preparation** including:
- Arrays, Strings, Hashing
- Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
- Trees, Graphs, Tries
- Recursion, Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming

🗂 That will also be documented publicly on GitHub with clean Java code, categorized by topic and difficulty.
